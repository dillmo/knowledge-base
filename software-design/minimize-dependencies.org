#+TITLE: Minimize Dependencies

Each function, method, or class should know as little about things outside
itself as possible. If possible, it should not know their names, their fields,
their structure, or the order of the arguments they take. When it is necessary
for a function, method, or class to know one of these things, that knowledge
should be isolated into a single function or method.

* Dependency Injection
Classes commonly need to store instances of other classes in their fields. To
avoid depending on the names of these other classes, do not instantiate them
inside the dependent class. Instead, take instances of those classes as
constructor arguments. This is called dependency injection.
