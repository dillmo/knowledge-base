#+TITLE: Treap

* Definition
A treap is a self-balancing binary search tree which is both a binary search
tree and a min-heap. Each node in the tree is assigned a random priority, and
rotations are used to keep the tree in heap order by these priorities. Thus, any
time a node is added to the tree, it is as if it was added in random order.

* Insertion
1. Insert the node using the binary search tree insertion algorithm.
2. Generate a random priority for the node.
3. If the node's priority is less than its parent's priority, use the tree
   rotation algorithm to swap it with its parent. Return to this step.
